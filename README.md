# R-D-Marine_Energy_Blue_Economy_Evaluation
Evaluated marine energy's role in green hydrogen production and carbon removal by identifying key opportunities and barriers. Analyzed 50+ expert interviews, developed a barrier analysis matrix, and co-authored a strategic report for the US National Renewable Energy Lab, shaping renewable energy policy.

# Context:
The integration of marine energy into green hydrogen production and marine carbon dioxide removal (mCDR) represents a promising avenue for advancing the blue economy. This project aimed to explore the potential synergies between these sectors, identifying key opportunities and challenges through comprehensive research and industry engagement.

# Project Overview:
As a Research and Development Specialist, I contributed to evaluating emerging opportunities for marine energy within green hydrogen production and mCDR. My role involved analyzing market trends, conducting qualitative analysis of over 50 expert interviews, and assisting in the development of strategic frameworks. The research resulted in a co-authored report for the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), providing insights expected to influence future renewable energy policies and initiatives.

# Methods Used:

* Qualitative Analysis: Conducted and analyzed interviews with industry experts, investors, and scientists to assess the feasibility of integrating marine energy into green hydrogen production and mCDR.

* Barrier Analysis Matrix: Contributed to the development of a three-tier barrier analysis matrix to identify and categorize obstacles to adopting marine energy in these sectors.

* Strategic Report Development: Collaborated in the co-authorship of a strategic report that outlines key opportunities, challenges, and policy recommendations, providing actionable insights for stakeholders.

# Skills:

* Research & Development: Applied expertise in evaluating opportunities within renewable energy sectors, focusing on marine energy.
  
* Qualitative Analysis: Utilized skills in conducting and analyzing expert interviews to generate valuable insights.
  
*Strategic Collaboration: Worked alongside a multidisciplinary team to develop frameworks and strategic documents that inform policy and industry practices.

* Interdisciplinary Coordination: Coordinated with stakeholders across academia, government, and industry to contribute to impactful research outcomes.
